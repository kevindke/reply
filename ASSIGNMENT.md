# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> With reply, the functions and methods were actually not too hard to follow. What made it easy to understand was how the options modules were indented, so the methods were able to understand much easier, looking at is just as an array or map. I think having the code maybe more split up in terms of functions would have been nicer to see how they are all seperate rather than one calling upon another all the time.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Comments have always been hard for me, but its very useful. I would tell them to make sure and not say exactly what is happening, code wise, but to comment on it as if someone just wants to know why the method exists.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 7.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I discussed the format of comments with Rylan Bonnevie and Adrian Pacheco.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Formatting of the comments was hard to pin point so maybe be more clear on that.
